Your code is **almost correct**, but there are two key things to address:

---

### ‚ùå Issue 1: Typo in variable name

You wrote:

```js
s.rmdir('example', err => {
```

But it should be:

```js
fs.rmdir('example', err => {
```

‚úÖ Make sure `fs` is required at the top:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
```

---

### ‚ùå Issue 2: `fs.rmdir` is **deprecated** in recent Node.js versions (v14+).

It‚Äôs better to use `fs.rm` with `{ recursive: true }` when removing folders.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended Code (modern way):

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.rm('example', { recursive: true, force: true }, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log('Deleted the folder successfully');
  }
});
```

### üîç Explanation:

* `recursive: true`: deletes the folder **and everything inside it**.
* `force: true`: does not throw error if folder doesn't exist.

---

### üß† Tip:

If you're using older Node.js and want to use `fs.rmdir`, make sure the folder is **empty**, or it will throw an error.

Let me know your Node.js version (`node -v`) if you want a version-specific solution.
